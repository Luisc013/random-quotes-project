https://github.com/JS-Beginners/random-quotes-project This Random Quotes project is fairly simple. 

It calls for you to access the properties on an object that's embedded inside of an Array. 
When the “Generate Quote” button is pressed, it triggers a change in quote and the author who said it.

What to accomplish:
Download the source code from the github repository above.
Delete the contents of the app.js file (except for the  quotes and author content of the array).
Implement the JavaScript code in your own app.js file.

What you should see:
 When you click on the “Generate” button, you should see a new random quote and the corresponding author.
